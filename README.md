# Indian Railways Data Analytics

This repository contains a Python project analyzing Indian Railways datasets to identify inefficiencies and operational patterns. The project provides insights into various aspects of railway operations to support better decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: 
  - Identifies inefficiencies in railway operations.
  - Highlights patterns in passenger trends, revenue generation, and operational delays.
- **Visualization**:
  - Data visualizations created using Matplotlib.
  - Clear graphical representations of key metrics.

## Tools and Technologies

- **NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Data Sources**: CSV/Excel files of Indian Railways datasets.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreyash0019/Railways-Dataset-Analytics.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. Open and run the Python scripts in the `Data` folder for analysis.
4. Explore the visualizations and insights generated by the script.

## Dashboard Highlights

- Revenue trends by zones.
- Passenger statistics.
- Delay analysis and causes.
